# Roulette-prediction-with-graph-using-Python

A simple command-line Roulette game built using Python, designed to simulate the randomness of a real roulette wheel. This project offers a fun way to practice Python programming, randomness, and game logic.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **Python** â€“ Core programming language for game logic.
- **random module** â€“ To simulate the unpredictability of a spinning roulette wheel.
- **Matplotlib** â€“ For basic graphical representations (optional).
- **IDE/Text Editor** â€“ Such as VS Code, PyCharm, or Sublime Text.
- **Python Interpreter** â€“ To run the game.

---

##  Objectives
- Simulate the behavior of a roulette wheel (numbers, colors, rules).
- Use random number generation for realistic game outcomes.
- Allow users to play multiple rounds in a loop.

---

##  Methodology
1. Represent the roulette wheel (numbers, colors).
2. Generate outcomes using the `random` module.
3. Implement a game loop for continuous play.
4. Test and refine for a smooth experience.

---

##  Motivation
- Reinforce Python skills through a practical, engaging project.
- Learn to implement randomness and game logic.

---

##  Run the Game
Make sure you have Python installed. Then run:

```bash
python roulette_game.py
```
